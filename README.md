# Cistrome_imputation
This is the simplified version of imputation project's code. The motivation of the imputation project is the fact that it is still not possible to perform TF Chip-seq assays for every expressed transcription factor (TF) against all cell types/tissues to get their binding sites. However, with the help of the most comprehensive DNase and Chip-seq database (Cistrome DB), we could turn to computational and statistical approaches to impute the TF biding sites.
